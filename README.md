Global Evidence Store

One of the fundamental issues faced in computer science is saving data in less space. It is even more vital in the 
digital forensic laboratories, where evidence files cross terabytes. Increased capacity of storage devices in consumer 
electronic products like personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc. is one of the reasons contributing towards 
the backlog of cases. The sensitive nature of these evidence files makes it a difficult decision for the labs to either 
maintain an on-premises storage facility or move towards cloud. In either case, storage capacity is never enough. 


With increasing accessibility of consumer electronics with high storage space, computation capabilities, and high speed internet, digital evidence Essential for any criminal proceedings or civil litigation. This paper presents Global Evidence Store (GlobES)- global archival storage software that helps in saving digital evidence files by running 
them through a block level deduplication algorithm that saves all the data in a key-value database.
